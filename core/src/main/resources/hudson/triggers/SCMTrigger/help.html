  Configure Jenkins to poll changes in SCM.--

  <p>
  Note that this is going to be an expensive operation for CVS, as every polling
  requires Jenkins to scan the entire workspace and verify it with the server.
  Consider setting up a "push" trigger to avoid this overhead, as described in
  <a href="https://jenkins.io/redirect/scm-change-trigger">this document</a>
