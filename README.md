# Simplified Chinese Plugin

Simplified Chinese Localization for Jenkins core and plugins.  
See [JEP-216](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/216/README.adoc) for design details.

# Limitation

The plugin only support *.jelly and help-*.html localization resources for now.

# How-To Guides

Here are some guides about [how to contribute localization](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/internationalization/) for a Jenkins plugin.

# Contribution

If you are interested in localization, please check [Chinese Localization SIG](https://jenkins.io/sigs/chinese-localization/) first.

All Chinese characters will convert to ASCII. It's hard to read. So you could use [online tools](https://native2ascii.net/).

Everyone should follow the [translation specification](specification.md).
