Simplified Chinese Localization for Jenkins core and plugins.  
See [JEP-216](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/216/README.adoc) for design details.

## Out of the box

We offer you an out-of-the-box solution. If you're going to install a fresh Jenkins, please [check here](https://github.com/jenkins-zh/docker-zh).

## How-To Guides

Here are some guides about [how to contribute localization](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/internationalization/) for a Jenkins plugin.

[jcli](https://github.com/jenkins-zh/jenkins-cli) could help you upload this plugin into your
Jenkins. The command is `jcli plugin upload`.

## Contribution

If you are interested in localization, please check [Chinese Localization SIG](https://jenkins.io/sigs/chinese-localization/) first.

All Chinese characters will convert to ASCII. It's hard to read. So you could use [online tools](https://native2ascii.net/).

Everyone should follow the [translation specification](https://github.com/jenkins-zh/translation-spec/blob/master/specification.md).

## Actions

We use [git-backup-actions](https://github.com/jenkins-zh/git-backup-actions/) to backup this repo into
